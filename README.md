# FOODr3k
###### A REACTATHON HACK BUILT MARCH 11-12 IN REACT NATIVE
### PROBLEM

"Analysis paralysis or paralysis by analysis is the state of over-analyzing (or over-thinking) a situation so that a decision or action is never taken, in effect paralyzing the outcome... rather than try something and change if a major problem arises. A person might be seeking the optimal or "perfect" solution"
[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis)

### SOLUTION

When you're open to anything, we put everything into the palm of your hand using our app, FOODr3k. With a single tap, this app will take all of the pressure off answering the age old question of  "What should we eat?".

While a person can never be perfect, we believe that we've created something that takes the pressure of a perfect decision off of the user. Sometimes the right choice is making one to begin with.

### TECH STACK  - API -  USAGE

We leverage the robust OpenTable API, the dynamic react-native framework along with its built in map features to bring you FOODr3k on iOS and Android. When the Find Restaurant button is tapped, a call to the API is made. That response is filtered into our propriety algorithm and a marker representing FOODr3k's decision is rendered as a marker on the screen. Tapping on the marker will reveal the restaurant's information, including an option to book reservations on the OpenTable website and placing a call.

### FUTURE/STRETCH GOALS

We would like to expand FOODr3k into a more complete, social experience. This includes being able to place a reservation, notify your friends through social media, and ultimately being able to plan around landmarks/events.
